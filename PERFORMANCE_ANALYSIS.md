# Performance Analysis Report

## Overview
This document outlines potential performance bottlenecks identified in the codebase and provides recommendations for improvements.

## Backend Performance Issues

### Database Queries

1. **N+1 Query Problem**
   - **Issue**: In repositories like `postRepository.ts` and `commentRepository.ts`, there are potential N+1 query patterns when fetching related data.
   - **Impact**: Excessive database queries leading to slower API response times.
   - **Recommendation**: Use Prisma's `include` to fetch related data in a single query. For example:
     ```typescript
     // Instead of separate queries for posts and then comments
     const posts = await prisma.post.findMany({
       include: {
         author: true,
         comments: true,
         votes: true,
         _count: {
           select: { comments: true }
         }
       }
     });
     ```

2. **Missing Indexes**
   - **Issue**: The Prisma schema doesn't define indexes for frequently queried fields.
   - **Impact**: Slow query performance, especially as data grows.
   - **Recommendation**: Add indexes to frequently queried fields in the Prisma schema:
     ```prisma
     model Post {
       // existing fields
       @@index([authorId])
     }
     
     model Comment {
       // existing fields
       @@index([postId])
       @@index([authorId])
     }
     ```

3. **Large Result Sets**
   - **Issue**: Some repository methods fetch all records without pagination.
   - **Impact**: Excessive memory usage and slow response times.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement pagination for all list endpoints:
     ```typescript
     async getPosts(page = 1, limit = 10) {
       return prisma.post.findMany({
         skip: (page - 1) * limit,
         take: limit,
         // other options
       });
     }
     ```

### API Endpoints

1. **Missing Response Caching**
   - **Issue**: Frequently accessed data is fetched from the database on every request.
   - **Impact**: Unnecessary database load and slower response times.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data:
     ```typescript
     // Example with Redis caching
     async getPostById(id: string) {
       const cacheKey = `post:${id}`;
       const cachedPost = await redisClient.get(cacheKey);
       
       if (cachedPost) return JSON.parse(cachedPost);
       
       const post = await prisma.post.findUnique({ where: { id: Number(id) }, ... });
       await redisClient.set(cacheKey, JSON.stringify(post), 'EX', 3600); // 1 hour cache
       return post;
     }
     ```

2. **Heavy Authentication Middleware**
   - **Issue**: The authentication middleware performs database lookups on every protected request.
   - **Impact**: Adds latency to all authenticated requests.
   - **Recommendation**: Cache user sessions and implement JWT token verification without database lookups when possible.

### File Handling

1. **Inefficient File Uploads**
   - **Issue**: File uploads are processed synchronously and stored locally.
   - **Impact**: Blocks the event loop during uploads and doesn't scale well.
   - **Recommendation**: Use streaming uploads to cloud storage (S3, Google Cloud Storage) and process files asynchronously.

## Frontend Performance Issues

### Rendering Performance

1. **Excessive Re-renders**
   - **Issue**: Components like `PostDetails.tsx` and `Dashboard.tsx` may re-render unnecessarily.
   - **Impact**: Poor UI responsiveness, especially on slower devices.
   - **Recommendation**: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders:
     ```jsx
     // Memoize expensive components
     const MemoizedPostList = React.memo(PostList);
     
     // Memoize expensive calculations
     const sortedPosts = useMemo(() => sortPosts(posts), [posts]);
     
     // Memoize callback functions
     const handleVote = useCallback((postId, voteType) => {
       // vote logic
     }, []);
     ```

2. **Large Component Trees**
   - **Issue**: Some pages render large component trees at once.
   - **Impact**: Slow initial page load and poor responsiveness.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement virtualization for long lists and lazy loading for components:
     ```jsx
     import { FixedSizeList } from 'react-window';
     
     function PostList({ posts }) {
       return (
         <FixedSizeList
           height={500}
           width="100%"
           itemCount={posts.length}
           itemSize={120}
         >
           {({ index, style }) => (
             <div style={style}>
               <PostItem post={posts[index]} />
             </div>
           )}
         </FixedSizeList>
       );
     }
     ```

### Network Optimization

1. **Multiple API Calls**
   - **Issue**: Components make multiple separate API calls to fetch related data.
   - **Impact**: Increased network overhead and slower page loads.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement GraphQL or create composite endpoints that return all necessary data in a single request.

2. **Missing Data Prefetching**
   - **Issue**: Data is only fetched after components mount.
   - **Impact**: Visible loading states and poor user experience.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement data prefetching for anticipated user actions:
     ```jsx
     // Prefetch post details when hovering over a post in a list
     function PostListItem({ post, prefetchPostDetails }) {
       return (
         <div 
           onMouseEnter={() => prefetchPostDetails(post.id)}
         >
           {post.title}
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

### State Management

1. **Inefficient Context Usage**
   - **Issue**: Global contexts like `AuthContext` and `PostContext` may cause unnecessary re-renders.
   - **Impact**: Poor performance across the application.
   - **Recommendation**: Split contexts into smaller, more focused contexts and use context selectors:
     ```jsx
     // Instead of one large context
     const { user, posts, comments, notifications } = useAppContext();
     
     // Use separate contexts
     const user = useUserContext();
     const posts = usePostContext();
     ```

## Authentication Flow

1. **Synchronous Password Hashing**
   - **Issue**: Password hashing in `authService.ts` is performed synchronously.
   - **Impact**: Blocks the event loop during authentication.
   - **Recommendation**: Use async versions of bcrypt functions and consider implementing rate limiting.

## Memory Usage

1. **Potential Memory Leaks**
   - **Issue**: Event listeners and subscriptions may not be properly cleaned up.
   - **Impact**: Increasing memory usage over time.
   - **Recommendation**: Ensure all event listeners and subscriptions are cleaned up in useEffect cleanup functions:
     ```jsx
     useEffect(() => {
       const subscription = someService.subscribe();
       
       return () => {
         subscription.unsubscribe();
       };
     }, []);
     ```
