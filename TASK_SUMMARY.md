# Task Summary

## 1. README.md Update

The README.md has been completely revamped to provide comprehensive information about the project:

- Added detailed project overview and features
- Documented the tech stack (Backend: Express.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL; Frontend: React 19, Material-UI)
- Included project structure diagrams for both backend and frontend
- Added setup instructions with environment variable requirements
- Listed available scripts for development, testing, and building
- Added API documentation reference and testing information
- Included contribution guidelines

## 2. Test Coverage Report Setup

Implemented test coverage reporting for both backend and frontend:

### Backend
- Added `test:coverage` script to package.json
- Configured Jest to generate detailed coverage reports
- Set up coverage thresholds (70% for statements, branches, functions, and lines)
- Excluded configuration files and infrastructure code from coverage requirements
- Current coverage is very low (0% across all metrics), indicating a need for more tests

### Frontend
- Added `test:coverage` script to package.json
- Current coverage is 0% across all metrics
- Tests are failing due to missing dependencies, which should be addressed

## 3. Performance Analysis

Created a comprehensive performance analysis report (PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md) that identifies potential bottlenecks:

### Backend Performance Issues
- N+1 query problems in repositories
- Missing database indexes
- Large result sets without pagination
- Missing response caching
- Heavy authentication middleware
- Inefficient file upload handling

### Frontend Performance Issues
- Excessive component re-renders
- Large component trees without virtualization
- Multiple separate API calls
- Missing data prefetching
- Inefficient context usage

### Other Issues
- Synchronous password hashing
- Potential memory leaks

### Recommendations
- Short-term, medium-term, and long-term improvement strategies
- Monitoring recommendations for ongoing performance optimization

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Test Coverage**:
   - Fix existing test failures
   - Add more unit tests for services, repositories, and controllers
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints
   - Add frontend component tests

2. **Implement Performance Improvements**:
   - Start with the short-term recommendations from the performance analysis
   - Prioritize database query optimizations and pagination
   - Implement component memoization in the frontend

3. **Setup Monitoring**:
   - Implement application performance monitoring
   - Set up database query monitoring
   - Add frontend performance metrics tracking
